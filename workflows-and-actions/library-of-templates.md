When you create a new workflow, you have a choice to create it from scratch or use one of the templates from a library:

If you select `Create from template` you will see a powerful library of templates, created by our team:

These templates can give you an opportunity to automate some common functional tasks, such as converting data to various reports and sending it somewhere or you can also automate your role-specific processes.&#x20;

For example, if you work for payment operations, you will find powerful workflows to automate the monitoring of failed payments, stuck bank transactions, and so on.

In addition to that, you save your own workflows as templates and the other users from your organization will be able to reuse them.

To do it, just go to the [list of workflows](https://app.datamin.io/workflows), select the necessary workflow and click on `Save as template`
