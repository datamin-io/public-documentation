When you create a new pipeline or a new metric, you have a choice to create it from scratch or use one of the templates from a library:

If you select "**Create from template**" you will see a powerful library of templates, created by our team:

These templates allow you to automate common streaming or functional tasks, such as streaming from an API to a database and the other way around, accepting streaming from queue messengers, converting data to various formats, and sending it somewhere or you can also automate your role-specific processes.&#x20;

In addition to that, you can save your pipelines as templates and the other users from your organization will be able to reuse them.

To do it, just go to the list of pipelines, select the necessary workflow, and click on "**Save as template"**

And the new template will be available under the tabs "**My organization's templates**" and "**My templates**":
