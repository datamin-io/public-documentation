# Reporting

## General reporting framework

General reporting with Ylem requires the following 4 steps:

* Retrieve data or receive it automatically from streaming or queueing software
* Convert to CSV or XML format
* Send a file via Email or any other convenient way
* Schedule this pipeline to run with the necessary frequency
