# Message Bus

**Message Bus** in a nutshell is a pattern that enables communication between various components of a system by acting as an intermediary for exchanging messages. Message Bus Architecture is based on the principle of decoupling different components of a system by using a message broker for communication.

And that is what Ylem is perfectly made for.

Typically Message Bus implements one of the following models:

* [Publish-subscribe](publish-subscribe-channel.md)
* [Point-to-point](point-to-point-channel.md)

Click on the links above :point\_up: to read about how both patterns can be implemented with Ylem.
