# Connecting an integration

## Types of Integration

We support a wide range of integrations that belong to the following categories:

* Push ([Apache Kafka](library-of-integrations/apache-kafka.md), [RabbitMQ](library-of-integrations/rabbitmq.md), [Google Pub/Sub](library-of-integrations/google-pub-sub.md), [AWS S3](library-of-integrations/aws-s3.md), etc.)
* Read/Write ([APIs](library-of-integrations/apis.md), [Snowflake](library-of-integrations/snowflake.md), [MySQL](library-of-integrations/mysql.md), [PostgreSQL](library-of-integrations/postgresql.md) and other SQL-based integrations)
* Write ([Google Sheets](library-of-integrations/google-sheets.md), [Slack](library-of-integrations/slack.md), [Tableau](library-of-integrations/tableau.md), [WhatsApp](library-of-integrations/whatsapp-through-twilio.md), and other software)
* Read-only ([Elasticsearch](library-of-integrations/elasticsearch.md))

More integrations and information about connecting them can be found in our [library](library-of-integrations/). And this list is growing since we are constantly adding new ones.

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend having both production and testing integrations connected, so you can always properly test your pipelines before using them on production.
