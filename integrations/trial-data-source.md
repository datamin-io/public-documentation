# Initial demo data source

At Ylem we believe that it is vitally important for SaaS products to supply customers with trial data that they can use to give a product a proper try instead of working with empty pipelines.

Therefore, when you create an account, it is automatically connected to the public data source for reading and research purposes. Currently, it is connected to the Public Rfam MySQL database, and more information about it can be found in their [official documentation](https://docs.rfam.org/en/latest/database.html).
