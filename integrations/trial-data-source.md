# Trial data source

At Ylem we believe that it is vitally important for SaaS products to supply customers with trial data that they can use to give a product a proper try instead of working with empty pipelines.

Therefore, when you create an account, you get it connected to our trial data source, which provides you with several databases with tables full of data, allowing you to play with your pipelines effectively and see how your organization can benefit from using Ylem without even connecting your integrations.
