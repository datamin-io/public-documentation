# Trial data source

At Datamin we believe that it is vitally important for SaaS products to supply customers with trial data that they can use to give a product a proper try instead of working with empty pipelines.&#x20;

Therefore when you create an account you get it connected to our trial data source, which provides you with several databases with tables full of data, that allow you to play with your pipelines effectively and see how your organization can benefit from using Datamin without even connecting your integrations yet.
