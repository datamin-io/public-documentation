# Initial demo data source

At Ylem, we believe that it is vitally important for SaaS products to supply customers with trial data so that they can give a product a proper try instead of working with empty pipelines.

Therefore, when you create an account, it is automatically connected to the demo data source for reading and research purposes. It contains several databases with data related to finance, e-commerce, hr, compliance, etc.

You can explore it and play with it in pipeline [Queries](../pipelines/tasks-ip/query.md).
