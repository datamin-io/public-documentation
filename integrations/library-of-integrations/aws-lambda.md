# AWS Lambda

**Integration type**:  `Push`

AWS Lambda allows you to listen to various events in the AWS universe. Therefore these data can immediately be streamed to Datamin by triggering our [API for pipelines](../../api/api-endpoints.md#run-pipeline).

We are building an open-source AWS Lambda function for you and it is coming live soon.

Until then you can just write a basic function on your own and stream data from AWS to Datamin in real-time.
