# RabbitMQ

**Integration type**:  `Push`

RabbitMQ allows you to listen to various events in your infrastructure. At the same time, Datamin can become one of the consumers of RabbitMQ messages.

For this integration, you can use our [open-source RabbitMQ consumer](https://github.com/datamin-io/datamin-rabbitmq-consumer).

Read the detailed [documentation about how to configure it here](https://github.com/datamin-io/datamin-rabbitmq-consumer/blob/main/README.md).
