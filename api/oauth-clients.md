# OAuth clients

In case you want to execute Ylem's pipelines by triggering our [API Endpoints](api-endpoints.md) from external applications (e.g. AWS Lambda, Airflow, Jenkins, etc), first you need to create an OAuth client.

To do that go to [https://app.datamin.io/api-clients](https://app.datamin.io/api-clients) and click on "**Add OAuth Client**"

Give it a name and click on "**Save**". Do not forget to **copy and save** its client secret. You won't be able to see it again in the UI.
