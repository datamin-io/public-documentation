# Metric management

The functionality of metrics allows you quickly and easily create [OKRs, KPIs, SLAs, and custom metrics](../use-cases-examples-templates/okrs-and-custom-metrics.md), schedule them and execute various workflows based on their value.

Management of metrics consists 5 simple steps:

## Give metric a name

## Define how to retrieve data for your metric

As same as in the case of workflows you can choose between using a visual UI or an SQL interface:

## Define how to calculate your metric

The same [mathematical functions](../workflows/tasks-ip/mathematical-functions.md) as in the case of workflow tasks are supported:

## Define how often or when to calculate your metric

Scheduling workflows are described [here](../workflows/running-and-scheduling-workflows.md#automatically-by-a-schedule).

## Define thresholds and workflows to run

And now as the final and most important step, you can define which workflows to execute depending on the value of your metric:

Some of the more detailed examples of metrics can be found here in the list of our use cases. Our [library of templates](../workflows/library-of-templates.md) also contains multiple ones, which you can use for configuring your own metrics.
