# Quick start guide

The shortest path to start streaming data with Datamin is to integrate with the source from where you want to stream, with the destination to where you want to stream and build a streaming pipeline for it.

Let's create two simple pipeline examples.&#x20;

The first pipeline will stream from a database to an API and will be run by a schedule. The second one will stream from Apache Kafka to a database and will be triggered from Kafka when a new message arrives on a topic.

## Example 1. Streaming from a database to an API

## Example 2. Streaming from Apache Kafka to a database
